Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

By offering money remittences and currency exchange they can capture a large portion of money market. They can render theoir services to different banks.

What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

The additional services may require front end SAP or Saphire to manage the daily operations globally. Furthurmore rather than focusing on peoiple skills 
company should seriously think in implemenytins AI technology to better monitor the market and exchange rates. 

Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

These technologies would be highly appropriate to maintain a competitive edge over competitors. again the thing to keep in mind is that the direct 
competitors do include major banks. To avoid being absorbed in future drastic changes like these would be required.
